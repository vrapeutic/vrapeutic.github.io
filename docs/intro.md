## Our Mission

VRapeutic (pronounced as vee-rapeutic) develops virtual reality software for therapeutic purposes, with a major focus on learning difficulties and developmental disorders.

We design AI-enabled and biosensors-enriched virtual environments specially tailored to instill diverse essential life skills for children, including: social, cognitive, and motor, and academic skills.

We aim to replace boring, inefficient, and high-cost therapeutic sessions with engaging and immersive experiences, that are customizable, trackable, affordable, and efficient.

## Therapeutic Modules
