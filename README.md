# VRapeutic Docs

VRapeutic's Docs Website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```bash
yarn install
```
or
```bash
npm install
```

## Local Development

```bash
yarn start
```
or
```bash
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```bash
yarn build
```
or
```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
