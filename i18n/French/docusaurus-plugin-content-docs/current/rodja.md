## Description 📝

Rodja is a module in which the player sees jewels on a road
around them and tries to collects jewels on it in front of them as fast as they
could while avoiding distractions.

## Story 🎙

The gameplay occurs on a track shaped in different shapes and cycling
around the player. There are multiple environments that the player and the track
can be placed in.

## Player

The player plays from a first person perspective. The player character is
not seen on the screen. Instead the player controls a circle pointer at the
center of his/her eyesight that they use to point at the jewels to collect
them.
The player controls the pointer only by moving their head around as the
pointer should express their eyes’ center’s direction.

## NPC

An NPC plays along the player to encourage them and tell them the rules
of the game.
The NPC has two options: either a boy or a girl.

## Goals

The player must collect all jewels before the time ends, or as fast as they
could, without getting distracted by distractions around them, or by the movement
of the jewels themselves.
